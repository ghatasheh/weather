## Architecture

This project is built on multi module MVVM Architecture. Each feature is in separate module and has 3 sub-modules; 

**Presentation Module**  contains  _UI (Composable functions)_  that are coordinated by  _ViewModels which execute 1 or multiple Use cases._  Presentation Layer depends on Domain and Data Layer.

**Domain Module** is the most INNER part of the onion (no dependencies with other layers) and it contains _Entities, Use cases & Repository Interfaces._ Use cases combine data from 1 or multiple Repository Interfaces.

**Data Module**  contains  _Repository Implementations and 1 or multiple Data Sources._  Repositories are responsible to coordinate data from the different Data Sources. Data Layer depends on Domain Layer.

## Next?
[] Add unit tests <br />
[] Add UI tests<br />
[] Improve app design<br />
[] Improve caching storage (move to Room)<br />
[] Better error handling<br />
[] Refactor Location work to support latest Android changes<br />
